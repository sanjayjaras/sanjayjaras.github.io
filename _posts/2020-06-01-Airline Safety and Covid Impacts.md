# Tough time for the airline industry
## Covid Impacts and Safety Concerns


## Covid Impacts:
The number of flights performed by the global airline industry
increased consistently since the early 2000s from 23.8 million yearly to
38.9 million by 2019. The covid-19 pandemic severely impacted the
airline industry. For the year 2020, before the covid pandemic, roughly
40.3 million flights were scheduled for the year. Because of covid
impacts and travel restrictions, the number of flights taken off is
reduced to only 16.9 million.

The number of passengers who used air travel consistently increased
from the year 2000 through 2019 from 1.38 billion passengers to 4.54
passengers. Similar to flight stats shown above, the number of
passengers that traveled in the year 2020 is significantly dropped to
1.79 billion. Things are improving in the year 2021; the first quarter
showed some positive signs. Due to new variants of covid US
government has imposed some new restrictions that can impact these
early good signs.

In the past few years(2015 through 2017), profit margins were pretty
consistent, around 35 billion US dollars annually for the global airline
industry. From the year 2018 onwards, fuel prices negatively impacted
airline profit margins. The profit margin was reduced to 30 billion US
dollars annually for the global airline industry. With this trend, for the
year 2020, profit margins of the global airline industry were forecasted
as 29.3 billion US dollars. However, due to covid impact and travel
restrictions, the global airline industry suffered an enormous loss of
118.5 billion US dollars. This loss trend continues in the year 2021 with
a loss of 38.7 billion US dollars in the first quarter.

## Safety Concerns:

Due to recent unfortunate airline crashes, the media has been
promoting statistics stating air is no longer a safe way to travel. The
news and media outlets have been bombarding the public with reports
and figures about the trends of airline safety and that things are not
looking good. Air travel was previously thought of as the safest way to
travel, especially when compared to automobiles. Air travel is now
being presented as one of the most dangerous to the public. Based on
accident data, we tried to analyze the truth behind all the safety
questions raised by the media.
For comparison, if we consider fatal road accidents that happened in
past years, we can see on an average 33 thousand fatal accidents occur
in the United States every year. The numbers are very much consistent
in the past 15 years.

If we compare these numbers with airline accidents, we can see that the
airline industry is continuously trying to become safe. On average, 956
fatalities in airline accidents happened in the whole world when
compared to 33 thousand average fatal road accidents in the United
States in the past 20 years. Though the number of accident numbers
increased from 2015, the overall trend indicates it is going down.

If we consider airline operators from the United States, the number of
fatal accidents is far less compared to road accidents. In the past 20
years(2000â€“2019), US operators were involved in 19 fatal accidents
out of 603 total events. This ratio of deadly accidents is considerably
meager, around 3%.

## Conclusion:

The airline industry is going through a tough time, and it will need
some time as well as support from governments. The Covid-19
pandemic has severely affected the airline industry; the loss they are
suffering is a huge one. As responsible citizens, we should not trust the
propaganda done by the media blindly. The airline industry is still a
safe medium of travel as before. To come out of the current
troublesome time airline industry need support from all of us.
